		<p>2. The attending physician or other provider of health care shall make the revocation a part of the declarant&rsquo;s medical record.</p>
		<p>(Added to NRS by 1977, 760; A 1987, 1309; 1991, 635)</p>
		<p>NRS 449.622 Recording determination of terminal condition and declaration.

		<p>(Added to NRS by 1991, 631)</p>
		<p>NRS 449.624 Treatment of qualified patients; withholding or withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration; treatment of pregnant patient.</p>
		<p>1. A qualified patient may make decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment so long as the patient is able to do so.</p>
		<p>2. NRS 449.535 to 449.690, inclusive, do not affect the responsibility of the attending physician or other provider of health care to provide treatment for a patient&rsquo;s comfort or alleviation of pain.</p>
		<p>3. Artificial nutrition and hydration by way of the gastrointestinal tract shall be deemed a life-sustaining treatment and must be withheld or withdrawn from a qualified patient unless a different desire is expressed in writing by the patient. For a patient who has no effective declaration, artificial nutrition and hydration must not be withheld unless a different desire is expressed in writing by the patient&rsquo;s authorized representative or the family member with the authority to consent or withhold consent.</p>
		<p>4. Life-sustaining treatment must not be withheld or withdrawn pursuant to a declaration from a qualified patient known to the attending physician to be pregnant so long as it is probable that the fetus will develop to the point of live birth with continued application of life-sustaining treatment.</p>
		<p>(Added to NRS by 1991, 631)</p>
		<p>NRS 449.626 Written consent to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment.</p>
		<p>1. If written consent to the withholding or withdrawal of the treatment, attested by two witnesses, is given to the attending physician, the attending physician may withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a patient who:</p>
		<p>(a) Has been determined by the attending physician to be in a terminal condition and no longer able to make decisions regarding administration of life-sustaining treatment; and</p>
		<p>(b) Has no effective declaration.</p>
		<p>2. The authority to consent or to withhold consent under subsection 1 may be exercised by the following persons, in order of priority:</p>
		<p>(a) The spouse of the patient;</p>
		<p>(b) An adult child of the patient or, if there is more than one adult child, a majority of the adult children who are reasonably available for consultation;</p>
		<p>(c) The parents of the patient;</p>
		<p>(d) An adult sibling of the patient or, if there is more than one adult sibling, a majority of the adult siblings who are reasonably available for consultation; or</p>
		<p>(e) The nearest other adult relative of the patient by blood or adoption who is reasonably available for consultation.</p>
		<p>3. If a class entitled to decide whether to consent is not reasonably available for consultation and competent to decide, or declines to decide, the next class is authorized to decide, but an equal division in a class does not authorize the next class to decide.</p>
		<p>4. A decision to grant or withhold consent must be made in good faith. A consent is not valid if it conflicts with the expressed intention of the patient.</p>
		<p>5. A decision of the attending physician acting in good faith that a consent is valid or invalid is conclusive.</p>
		<p>6. Life-sustaining treatment must not be withheld or withdrawn pursuant to this section from a patient known to the attending physician to be pregnant so long as it is probable that the fetus will develop to the point of live birth with continued application of life-sustaining treatment.</p>

		<p>2. A physician or other provider of health care, whose action pursuant to NRS 449.535 to 449.690, inclusive, is in accord with reasonable medical standards, is not subject to civil or criminal liability, or discipline for unprofessional conduct, with respect to that action.</p>
		<p>3. A physician or other provider of health care, whose decision about the validity of consent under NRS 449.626 is made in good faith, is not subject to civil or criminal liability, or discipline for unprofessional conduct, with respect to that decision.</p>

A person designated pursuant to NRS 449.600 or a person authorized to consent pursuant to NRS 449.626, whose decision is made or consent is given in good faith pursuant to NRS 449.535 to 449.690, inclusive, is not subject to civil or criminal liability, or discipline for unprofessional conduct, with respect to that decision.</p>
		<p>(Added to NRS by 1977, 760; A 1985, 1747; 1991, 635)</p>

		<p>2. No hospital or other medical facility, physician or person working under the direction of a physician is subject to criminal or civil liability for failure to follow the directions of the patient to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments.</p>
		<p>(Added to NRS by 1977, 761; A 1985, 1747; 1993, 2792)</p>
		<p>NRS 449.645 Assumption of validity of declaration; presumption of intent to use, withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment not created.</p>
		<p>1. Unless he or she has knowledge to the contrary, a physician or other provider of health care may assume that a declaration complies with NRS 449.535 to 449.690, inclusive, and is valid.</p>
		<p>2. NRS 449.535 to 449.690, inclusive, create no presumption concerning the intention of a person who has revoked or has not executed a declaration with respect to the use, withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in the event of a terminal condition.</p>
