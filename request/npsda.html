		<h2 class="title">The Patient Self-Determination Act, Which Includes Advance Directives, Requires Essential Care To Inform You of Your Rights as a Patient and of Our Policy</h2>
		<ol class="n-list">
			<li>You have the right to make decisions concerning your medical care.</li>
			<li>You have the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment, including the right to formulate advance directives (declarations and/or durable powers of attorney for health care decisions).</li>
			<li>You have the right to be given information concerning Advance Directives within 24 hours of your admission to this hospital.</li>
			<li>Upon admission, you will be asked if you have an advance directive.</li>
			<li>It will be documented in your medical record whether you have an advance directive.</li>
			<li>If you have an advance directive you should furnish a copy to this hospital, so it can be placed in and made a part of your medical record/chart, so hospital personnel are made aware of your medical treatment desires.</li>
			<li>If you have an advance directive it will be honored by the hospital. (If the hospital has a policy stating it cannot honor an advance directive on the basis of conscience objection, the hospital must include a clear and precise statement of limitation. At a minimum, a hospitalâ€™s statement of limitation must: a) clarify any differences between institution-wide conscience objection and those that may be raised by individual physicians; b) identify the state legal authority permitting such objection, which in Nevada is NRS 449.628; and c) describe the range, if any, of medical conditions or procedures affected by conscience objection).</li>
			<li>The hospital will not condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against you based on whether you have formulated an advance directive.</li>
			<li>For further information regarding advance directives, or to obtain advance directives forms, please contact Brenda Olsen, Owner of Essential Care at (702) 635-5264.</li>
			<li>For further information in the community you may contact the State of Nevada Department of Human Resources at (775) 684-4000 or Goodsell & Olsen, LLP at (702) 869-6261.</li>
